subtitle: why i'm taking cs 103
---

i'm huge creative! being a serial hobbyist, i partake in most hobbies that i can dom with my hands! i write, embroider, pattern-make when i'm feeling like torturing myself, draw, and of course, sew. when i was looking at what i should take for my div iii requirement, i was recommended electronic textiles, and i was extremely interested after realizing how well it would compliment my sewing, especially since i ocasionally cosplay.

another reason is that i'm pretty tech illiterate ;-; i know that i should be, considering the current landscape of the internet right now, and being tech illiterate will do me more of a disservance than anything else. so, i'm taking this class to remedy that! 

### my story

my name is Laura S. Balcázar Pou, and i'm a sophomore! i'm a WGSS/COMP major, concentrating in LATS. i was born and raised in Puerto Rico, up until when i was 13, and moved to NYC. i started 8th grade at a new york middle school, and four days in, quarantine hit. 

needless to say, my luck speaks for itself!

i graduated middle school wearing my robes in my bedroom, and i graduated high school pacing back and forth on a stage. i've been living in brooklyn for 6 years, now, and i probably won't move for the rest of my life! :-D
