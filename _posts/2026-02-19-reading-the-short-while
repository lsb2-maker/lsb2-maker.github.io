williams is not a campus lacking in library resources on my end, but i manage to nitpick the lack anyway. while the selection of zines in sawyer is incredible, the graphic novels section is notably lacking, which is miserable for me, as i lost the capacity to fully read books when i hit 16. luckily, right next to wood, maybe a two minute walk away from it, actually, is the local milne public library.
the milne library is the GOAT. besides it just being a great community spot full of resources, the graphic novel selection is fantastic. so, every time i finish reading the bunch of books i already have, i go and rent out a few more from the library.

one such book was the short while by jeremy sorese, a science fiction graphic novel. i was drawn by the descriptor at the back of the book, stating that the book took place in a "post-internet future". as a gen z born in 2006, it's hard for me to ever really rememver
