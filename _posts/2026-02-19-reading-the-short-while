williams is not a campus lacking in library resources on my end, but i manage to nitpick the lack anyway. while the selection of zines in sawyer is incredible, the graphic novels section is notably lacking, which is miserable for me, as i lost the capacity to fully read books when i hit 16. luckily, right next to wood, maybe a two minute walk away from it, actually, is the local milne public library.
the milne library is the GOAT. i go there every time i finish reading the bunch of books i finished blah blah blah this is example text i'll finish this l8terrrrr
